Hi,

Using whichever technology you see fit, please can you develop the following mocks.

Requirement:
+ This module will appear on the homepage of the website
+ The default state of the module is the first box open
+ Using whatever technique, javascript, flash, plugins etc… please make the boxes expand and collapse
+ All assets are supplied, if not, please comment and continue with the task
+ Please ignore all links href and use "#test"
+ Please comment on any assumptions you make within the code base

Interaction flow:

The blue boxes are interactive whereby they expand and collapse to reveal content

+ Partially open - Default state
+ Collapsed - all boxes closed
+ All boxes open - Reveals all content


Please do not spend more than 1 hours on the test and submit what you have done, explaining how you would complete the rest.

Please note, this is not a test for code completion, but for technical and practical approaches to Front End development.


Regards,
